# Handout

This is where I expect you to complete your homework. Note that all you have to
do is produce the necessary source file. I do provide a simple makefile to
make sure that everyone is working with a uniform setup and submits code that
is organized in the same fashion (e.g., executable names) to ease grading.

Please do follow that template!

Best.
