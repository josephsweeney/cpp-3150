# Objective

Create two programs that implement a polynomial ADT (Like in CSE3100).

- The first program should use pointers, and const as needed and use 
  a C++ style. Feel free to use the STL if need be. The modus operandi
  is KISS: Keep It Simple and Stupid. 

- The second program should use _references_, const and exceptions
  whenever needed to bring it even closer to a C++ way. Feel free to
  use the STL if need be.
  
# ADT Expectations

1. Polynomials are univariate
2. Polynomials can have an arbitrary degree
3. Polynomials are sums of monomials of the form c_k * x^k where c_k
   is a constant and k is the degree of the monomial.
4. You should be able to print a polynomial
5. You should be able to add a monomial to a polynomial (in place modification)
6. You should be able to add two polynomials (and get a new one as a
   result)
7. You should be able to evaluate a polynomial at a point (value for
   its variable). 
8. You should be able to read a polynomial from the standard
   input. Format should be


   `
   nbMono c0 k0  c1 k1 ....  cn kn
   `


     where nbMono is the number of monomials and each monomial is given
   by a pair `ci ki` in which `ci` is the coefficient (float) and `ki`
   is the exponent of the i^th term (an integer). 
   
# Goals

Your objective is to write as little code as possible and write code
that is elegant, highly readable, and easy to maintain. You can use
`struct` like in C. But do not attempt to make objects. Stick to
functions for now. 

# What to pay attention to

- Memory management
- const usage
- reference usage
- error handling

Good luck!
