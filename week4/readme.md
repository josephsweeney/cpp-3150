## Question 1 focuses on the map operation.

The goal is to apply an increment function to a provided set of data.
To do this successfully, you will have to create different
versions of the map operation.  The map operation takes two
parameters, a list of data and an operation to apply to the data.  It
returns a new container with the transformed data.

The multiple implementation use different mechanism to achieve the
composition. The whole point is to experiment with various ways to
achieve the map implementation and explore the trade-offs that 
pop up as a result.
